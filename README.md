# T-Gun
A simple 2D gunfight game intended for multiplayer usage (eventually) 
## Coding Standards
Code must be formatted according to the linux coding style, or, preferably, ran through `indent -linux -l1000i`
All code must be standard C99 (With the use of SDL and related libraries, of course.) without the use of GNU extensions.
Although the only supported platform is currently linux, make code as portable as possible.
